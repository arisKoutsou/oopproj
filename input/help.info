The game takes action on a grid.
The grid consist of tiles that can be:
	non Accessible, Common, or tiles that have a Market.

Common tiles have monsters. When a Hero
is passing by a Common tile, there is a 
chance that he is attacked by a Monster.
In that case, a Battle starts and the Hero
stays on that tile until all monsters are dead 
or until all heroes are dead. Heroes and Monsters 
attack each other taking turns.

You can control 1 to 3 Heroes of your choice.
A Hero can be one of the following:
	Warrior, Paladin, Sorcerer.
Each one of the above 3 kinds of Hero
has some boosts on specific specs.

*IMPORTANT: All Heroes spawn on the bottom left corner 
of the grid. From there you can start your Jurney.

Heroes move on the grid, killing monsters,
gaining Xp and Gold, leveling up and
buying items off markets.

Enjoy...
